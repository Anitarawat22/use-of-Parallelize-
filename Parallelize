ðŸš€ How to use Parallelize In spark



With the help of Parallelize :- parallelize() method is the SparkContext's parallelize method to create a parallelized collection. This allows Spark to distribute the data across multiple nodes, instead of depending on a single node to process the data.
I created a local data with the name of words and created rdd. As some words are small ,so we have to Normalize this words.To find the frequency of each word.
lower() converts the words data into lower-case.

ðŸš€ Kind of operations are two in spark :- Transformation and action.

In this Map and reduceByKey is a transformation and collect() is a action which shows the excecution of the data.



Map :- Number of output rows = Number of input keys.

reduceByKey :- Number of output = Number of distinct Keys.
